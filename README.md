Following the instructions from Rocketseat's PHP training I created this portfolio!
Different of [Portifolio PHP Class](https://github.com/csouza1995/rocket-portfolio-php-class) this project I do 100% alone

## Structure

Using only PHP files, it have four divisions:
- Header
- Hero
- Projects
- Footer

Each division has your own file with her self responsability, doing a componentization of project for a good organization of it

Inserted a method to translate pages from Portguese-Brazil to English


## Turn On

```php
php -S localhost:8888 -d auto_prepend_file=server.php
```
